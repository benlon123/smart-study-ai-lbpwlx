You want to create a \"SmartStudy AI\" app for GCSE & A-Level students with AI-powered lesson creation, flashcards, notes, exam questions, a task bar, settings, analytics, and premium features locked behind Apple Pay. Here's a plan to get started:\n\n**Features for the First Version:**\n\n*   **Home Screen:** A list of lessons, filterable by subject, level, and difficulty. Clicking a lesson opens its container with AI-generated notes, flashcards, exam questions, and a quiz.\n*   **Lesson Creation:** A \"Create Lesson\" button that allows users to select a subject, level (GCSE/A-Level), and difficulty. The AI then generates the lesson content.\n*   **Sign Up/Log In:** Implement the authentication flow with name, email, password, and \"Forgot Password\" functionality.\n\n**Design Elements:**\n\n*   **Colors:**\n    *   Background: `#F5F5DC` (Beige)\n    *   Text: `#2E294E` (Dark Indigo)\n    *   TextSecondary: `#6E798C` (Cool Grey)\n    *   Primary: `#7451EB` (Vivid Purple)\n    *   Secondary: `#A892FF` (Light Purple)\n    *   Accent: `#FF6F61` (Salmon)\n    *   Card: `#FFFFFF` (White)\n    *   Highlight: `#FFD700` (Gold)\n*   **Typography:** Use modern, clean fonts like \"System\" for a native feel.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Read Existing Files:** Use `read_file_tree()` to understand the project structure and identify relevant files, particularly in the `app/(tabs)` directory.\n2.  **Modify Home Screen:** Use `read_files()` to read the content of `app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx`. Then, create a plan to modify this file to display the list of lessons with filtering options. The lessons will be static for now.\n3.  **Implement Lesson Creation:** Create a new component for lesson creation.\n4.  **Implement Sign Up/Log In:** Create new components for sign up and log in.\n5.  **Remove Demo Content:** Remove the `modalDemos` array from `app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx`.\n\nLet's create an elegant and functional mobile app!\n"}, {"type": "role_transition", "from_role": "planner", "to_role": "coder", "timestamp": "2025-12-14T17:36:09.115468"}, {"type": "text", "text": "I'll help you create the SmartStudy AI app!
