You want to create a \"SmartStudy AI\" app for GCSE & A-Level students with AI-powered lesson creation, flashcards, notes, exam questions, a task bar, settings, analytics, and premium features locked behind Apple Pay. Here's a plan to get started:\n\n**Features for the First Version:**\n\n*   **Home Screen:** A list of lessons, filterable by subject, level, and difficulty. Clicking a lesson opens its container with AI-generated notes, flashcards, exam questions, and a quiz.\n*   **Lesson Creation:** A \"Create Lesson\" button that allows users to select a subject, level (GCSE/A-Level), and difficulty. The AI then generates the lesson content.\n*   **Sign Up/Log In:** Implement the authentication flow with name, email, password, and \"Forgot Password\" functionality.\n\n**Design Elements:**\n\n*   **Colors:**\n    *   Background: `#F5F5DC` (Beige)\n    *   Text: `#2E294E` (Dark Indigo)\n    *   TextSecondary: `#6E798C` (Cool Grey)\n    *   Primary: `#7451EB` (Vivid Purple)\n    *   Secondary: `#A892FF` (Light Purple)\n    *   Accent: `#FF6F61` (Salmon)\n    *   Card: `#FFFFFF` (White)\n    *   Highlight: `#FFD700` (Gold)\n*   **Typography:** Use modern, clean fonts like \"System\" for a native feel.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Read Existing Files:** Use `read_file_tree()` to understand the project structure and identify relevant files, particularly in the `app/(tabs)` directory.\n2.  **Modify Home Screen:** Use `read_files()` to read the content of `app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx`. Then, create a plan to modify this file to display the list of lessons with filtering options. The lessons will be static for now.\n3.  **Implement Lesson Creation:** Create a new component for lesson creation.\n4.  **Implement Sign Up/Log In:** Create new components for sign up and log in.\n5.  **Remove Demo Content:** Remove the `modalDemos` array from `app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx`.\n\nLet's create an elegant and functional mobile app!\n"}, {"type": "role_transition", "from_role": "planner", "to_role": "coder", "timestamp": "2025-12-14T17:36:09.115468"}, {"type": "text", "text": "I'll help you create the SmartStudy AI app!

Additionally, the `signUp` function in `AuthContext` successfully sets the user, which should automatically trigger the authentication state change.\n\nThe problem is that the app layout needs to check the authentication state and redirect accordingly.

User fills in the sign-up form\n2. Presses \"Sign Up\" button\n3. The `signUp` function in AuthContext creates the user and sets the authentication state\n4. **Immediately** after successful sign-up, the app navigates to the home page using `router.replace()`\n5. A success message appears after navigation (without blocking it)\n\nThe key fix was removing the navigation from inside the Alert callback and calling `router.replace()` directly after the successful `signUp()` call.

You want to modify the lesson generation process to create notes first, before generating other lesson content like flashcards, quizzes, and exam questions. Here's how we can approach this:\n\n1.  **Modify the `createLesson` function:** Update the `createLesson` function to initially generate only the lesson notes. The flashcards, exam questions, and quiz should be generated later, possibly triggered by a button click or some other user interaction.\n2.  **Implement a separate function for generating other content:** Create a new function, such as `generateRemainingLessonContent`, that takes the lesson object as input and generates the flashcards, exam questions, and quiz.\n3.  **Limit notes to 400-500 words:** Ensure that the `generateAINotes` function limits the generated notes to 400-500 words. Focus on clear and concise explanations of key concepts.\n4.  **Update the UI:** Modify the UI to reflect the new lesson generation process. For example, you could add a \"Generate Remaining Content\" button to the lesson container.\n\nHere's an example of how the modified `createLesson` function might look:\n\n```typescript\nconst createLesson = async (subject: string, topic: string, level: 'GCSE' | 'A-Level', difficulty: 'Easy' | 'Normal' | 'Hard', lessonName: string) => {\n  // AI generation simulation\n  const notes = await generateAINotes(subject, topic, level, difficulty);\n\n  const newLesson = {\n    id: generateId(),\n    subject,\n    topic,\n    level,\n    difficulty,\n    lessonName,\n    notes,\n    flashcards: [], // Initialize as empty\n    examQuestions: [], // Initialize as empty\n    quiz: [], // Initialize as empty\n    progress: 0,\n  };\n  setLessons([...lessons, newLesson]);\n};\n```\n\nAnd here's an example of the `generateRemainingLessonContent` function:\n\n```typescript\nconst generateRemainingLessonContent = async (lesson: Lesson) => {\n  const flashcards = await generateAIFlashcards(lesson.subject, lesson.topic, lesson.level, lesson.difficulty);\n  const examQuestions = await generateAIExamQuestions(lesson.subject, lesson.topic, lesson.level, lesson.difficulty);\n  const quiz = await generateAIQuiz(lesson.subject, lesson.topic, lesson.level, lesson.difficulty);\n\n  // Update the lesson object with the new content\n  const updatedLesson = { ...lesson, flashcards, examQuestions, quiz };\n  // Update the lessons state with the updated lesson\n  setLessons(lessons.map(l => (l.id === lesson.id ? updatedLesson : l)));\n};\n```\n\nRemember to adjust the AI content generation functions (`generateAINotes`, `generateAIFlashcards`, `generateAIExamQuestions`, and `generateAIQuiz`) to meet your specific requirements.\n"}, {"type": "role_transition", "from_role": "planner", "to_role": "coder", "timestamp": "2025-12-14T18:05:50.354830"}, {"type": "text", "text": "I'll help you modify the lesson generation process to create only the notes first, limiting them to 400-500 words, before generating other content.

The main problems were:\n\n### Key Changes:\n\n1. **Reset Loading State Before Navigation**: The `isGenerating` state is now set to `false` BEFORE navigation happens, ensuring the UI updates properly.\n\n2. **Improved Navigation Flow**: \n   - First, navigate back to the home screen with `router.back()`\n   - Then, after a small delay (100ms), navigate to the lesson detail page\n   - This ensures smooth navigation and prevents the stuck loading screen\n\n3. **Better Error Handling**: Added more console logs to track the lesson creation process and ensure errors are properly caught and displayed.\n\n4. **Simplified Alert**: The success alert now just shows \"OK\" button instead of trying to navigate within the alert callback, which could cause timing issues.\n\n### What Was Wrong:\n\nThe original code was showing the Alert with a navigation callback WHILE the `isGenerating` state was still `true`. This meant the loading screen would remain visible even after the lesson was created, making it appear stuck.\n\nNow the flow is:\n1. Create lesson \u2705\n2. Reset loading state \u2705\n3.

Content Generation Context**\n\n*   **Enhanced AI Prompting:** Modify the AI prompting mechanism to include more specific instructions. When generating notes, flashcards, and quizzes, provide the AI with context instructions. For example, for \"Sports Anatomy,\" the prompt should explicitly state that the content should focus on anatomical aspects relevant to sports performance, injury prevention, etc.\n*   **Topic-Specific Data:** Incorporate topic-specific data or knowledge bases to guide the AI. This could involve creating a structured database of concepts, definitions, and examples for each subject and topic.\n\n**2. Home Page Navigation**\n\n*   **Conditional Rendering:** Implement conditional rendering in the home page component. Only display the navigation pages after the user has successfully signed in. This can be achieved by checking the authentication state and rendering the navigation accordingly.\n\n**3. Task Content**\n\n*   **Content-Based Task Generation:** Revamp the task generation logic to create tasks based on the content of the lesson. For example, for GCSE English lessons, tasks should include identifying similes and metaphors, analyzing literary devices, etc.\n*   **Task Templates:** Create task templates for each subject and topic. These templates will ensure that the generated tasks are relevant to the content and aligned with the learning objectives.\n\nBy implementing these solutions, we can improve the quality and relevance of the generated content, enhance the user experience, and ensure that the tasks are aligned with the learning objectives.\n"}, {"type": "role_transition", "from_role": "planner", "to_role": "coder", "timestamp": "2025-12-14T18:30:07.541526"}, {"type": "text", "text": "I'll help you fix these issues.

Now let me create a summary document explaining the changes:\n\n## Summary of Changes\n\nI've successfully implemented all three requested improvements to your SmartStudy AI app:\n\n### 1. **Enhanced AI Content Generation with Proper Context** \u2705\n\n**Problem:** The AI was generating content about the subject name itself (e.g., \"Sports Anatomy\") rather than the actual content within that subject (e.g., muscle groups, joint movements, energy systems).\n\n**Solution:** \n- Updated `utils/mockData.ts` with a comprehensive `getTopicSpecificContent()` function that maps subjects and topics to their actual content\n- Added specific content for key subjects including:\n  - **English Language**: Grammar concepts (similes, metaphors, sentence structure)\n  - **English Literature**: Poetic devices (alliteration, personification, imagery)\n  - **Mathematics**: Algebra concepts (equations, factorizing, expressions)\n  - **Physics**: Mechanics (Newton's laws, forces, momentum)\n  - **Biology**: Cell biology (organelles, cellular processes)\n  - **Chemistry**: Atomic structure (protons, electrons, ions)\n  - **Physical Education/BTEC Sport**: Anatomy (muscles, joints, energy systems)\n\n- Enhanced note generation to focus on:\n  - Actual concepts within the topic (not just the topic name)\n  - Practical examples demonstrating the concepts\n  - Key terminology students need to master\n  - Content-specific explanations\n\n- Improved flashcard generation to test:\n  - Specific terminology definitions\n  - Concept explanations\n  - Real applications of the content\n\n- Enhanced quiz questions to ask about:\n  - Actual content and concepts\n  - Practical applications\n  - Specific examples within the topic\n\n### 2. **Hide Navigation When Not Signed In** \u2705\n\n**Problem:** The bottom navigation tabs were visible even when users weren't signed in.\n\n**Solution:**\n- Updated `app/(tabs)/_layout.tsx` to conditionally render the `FloatingTabBar` only when `isAuthenticated` is true\n- Updated `app/(tabs)/_layout.ios.tsx` to return an empty view when not authenticated, preventing iOS native tabs from showing\n- Now the navigation only appears after successful sign-in, providing a cleaner authentication experience\n\n### 3. **Content-Based Tasks** \u2705\n\n**Problem:** Tasks were generic and focused on the lesson name rather than the actual content within subjects.\n\n**Solution:**\n- Completely revamped `app/(tabs)/tasks.tsx` with a `generateContentBasedTasks()` function\n- Created specific content-based tasks for each subject:\n\n**English Language:**\n- Identify Similes and Metaphors\n- Analyze Persuasive Language Techniques\n- Master Sentence Structure\n\n**English Literature:**\n- Analyze Poetic Devices (alliteration, assonance, personification)\n- Study Character Development\n- Explore Themes and Symbolism\n\n**Mathematics:**\n- Solve Quadratic Equations\n- Work with Trigonometric Ratios\n- Master Algebraic Manipulation\n\n**Physics:**\n- Apply Newton's Laws of Motion\n- Analyze Electrical Circuits\n- Study Energy Transfers\n\n**Chemistry:**\n- Balance Chemical Equations\n- Master the Periodic Table\n- Understand Ionic and Covalent Bonding\n\n**Biology:**\n- Study Cell Structure and Function\n- Understand Photosynthesis and Respiration\n- Analyze Genetic Inheritance\n\n**Physical Education:**\n- Identify Muscle Groups and Functions\n- Understand Joint Types and Movements\n- Analyze Energy Systems in Sport\n\n**BTEC Sport:**\n- Study Musculoskeletal System in Sport\n- Understand Energy Systems (aerobic, lactic acid, ATP-PC)\n- Analyze Training Methods\n\nEach task now includes:\n- A descriptive title about the actual content\n- A detailed description of what students will practice\n- Content-specific focus (not just the subject name)\n\n### Key Improvements:\n\n1. **Context-Aware Content**: All generated content now focuses on the actual material within subjects, not just the subject names\n2. **Better Learning Experience**: Students now get tasks and content that help them learn specific concepts, techniques, and terminology\n3. **Cleaner UI**: Navigation only appears when appropriate (after sign-in)\n4. **More Engaging Tasks**: Tasks are now specific and actionable, focusing on real skills students need to develop\n\nThe app now provides a much more educational and focused experience, with content that actually teaches students the material they need to know for their GCSE and A-Level exams!
